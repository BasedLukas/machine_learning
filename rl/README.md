#### Tree
Tree is a simple tree that can be followed or traversed, where each node has a fixed underlying value [-1,1] where all daughter nodes values sum to 0.
However on each visit to the node the current value is drawn from a distribution centred around that value, to add some uncertainty. This means there is an optimal way to follow the tree, but it is not immediately apparent.
